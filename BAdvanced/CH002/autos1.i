/* Only Microsoft could attempt to justify this insanity: when building

 * possible conflict with a user defined symbol; (bogus because the macro
 * must be user defined anyway -- it is not a private symbol -- and in
 * any case, the Windows API already reserves the UNICODE symbol as
 * a user defined macro, with equivalent intent.
 *
 * The real explanation, of course, is that this is just another example
 * of Microsoft irrationality; in any event, there seems to be no sane
 * scenario in which defining one without the other would be required,
